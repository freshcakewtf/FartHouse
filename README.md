**Ever wondered what it would be like if your house had a bum? Wonder no more!**

In **Fart House**, you take control of a house with a hearty rear end, soaring through a linear world of sewage pipes and beans. Yes, you read that right—a flying butt-house that farts its way across this Flappy Bird-style game!

## Game Overview

Navigate past the pipes with nothing but your cheeky puffs of gas to clear the way. Collect as many beans as you can while trying to avoid running into everything else. Each bean adds to your score and proves that even a house with a bum can live its best life!

So, strap in (or should we say, buckle up?) for the most flatulent flight of your life. Fart House—because sometimes, the only way to escape your problems is to let them rip!
